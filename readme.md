## Description

This was an early MEAN stack application, to allow users to store and view their
favorite movies in an easy way. It was also the first project we used Grunt to
help build. This project was simple looking back, but challenging at the time.

## Installation

Clone the repository, then run `npm install` and `npm start`.
